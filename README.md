# SPICE

The fetch_spice.py script allows you to download SPICE data and save it as a netCDF file. In order to run the script you must have installed the necessary dependencies. A requirements.txt file is provided to make this easy. The following is an example of how the script can be run from the command line:

`python fetch_spice.py SPICE38 2023-09-01T00:00:00Z 2023-09-30T23:59:59Z test.nc`

Running the script with the -h flag shows what all of the different parameters are:
```
python fetch_spice.py -h
usage: fetch_spice.py [-h] spice start_ts end_ts path

Download and save SPICE data.
